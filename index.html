                    <p>ITN-DCH FINAL CONFERENCE is an international event for the professionals of multiple disciplines and scholars working in the Digital Cultural Heritage domain. The aim of the conference is to bring together experts, stakeholders and researchers from the cultural domain and, addressing the current challenges, start a dialogue that will lay the foundation for the creation of a multidisciplinary community of practice..
                    </p>

                    <p>The<a href="http://itn-dch.eu/">“Initial Training Network for Digital Cultural Heritage: Projecting our Past to the Future”</a> with acronym ITN-DCH, is the first and one of the largest Marie Curie fellowship projects in the area of the e-documentation / e-preservation and CH protection funded by the European Union under the FP7 PEOPLE research framework. The Project started on the 1st of October 2013 and its consortium comprising of 14 full partners and 10 associate members covering the entire spectrum of European CH actors, ranging from academia, research institutions, industry, museums, archives and libraries. The project aims to train 20 fellows (16 ESR’s and 4 ER’s – 500 person months) in the area of CH digital documentation, preservation and protection in order to create them a strong academic profile and market oriented skills which will significantly contribute to their career prospects.</p>

                    <p>Digital Cultural Heritage is a complex domain that requires new requires new skills, advanced techniques and constantly upgrading know-how; for the fulfillment of which a multilevel training and an interdisciplinary collaboration among experts is necessary in order for common methodologies and best practises for the profound understanding of our past to be established. It is important to create a forum of discussion where diverse leading academic scientists, researchers, practitioners and educators are brought together to exchange and share their experience, as well as confront each others on the challenges and advancements in each of their domain. The scope of the conference is, therefore, to:</p>

                    <ol>
              <li>Encourage interdisciplinary and innovative analysis in the cultural domain
</li>
              <li>Promote synergies and knowledge exchange between the participants</li>
              <li>Develop multidisciplinary connections for future development</li>
              <li>Disseminate the results of innovative research</li>
              <li>Publish the results of applied work as well as innovative concepts that would help shape our current understanding of cultural heritage</li>
              </ol>

             <p>To this cause, we are seeking for original and innovative contributions in theoretical and practical applications on Digital Cultural Heritage, in the following themes., we are seeking original and innovation contributions in theoretical and practical applications of digital cultural heritage.</p>

                      <p>
                        The aim of the workshop is to introduce the participants to the concept of linked data and to a selection of data curation tools that can be used for re-using and integrating data from across data silos (including examples from tangible and intangible heritage), including a demonstration of how semantically map them. The tutorial will make use of open source tools and existing standard resources for from the cultural heritage domain in order to demonstrate this process. Emphasis will be laid on the transformation of existing resources (CSV, XML etc.) into RDF, through the use of data transformation mapping tools. </p>
                        <p>The workshop will last a half day and it will promote a hands-on knowledge of several important tools that are daily used by professionals in the field. Participants will finish the workshop with a greater familiarity with both the overall workflow and strategy for creating linked data but also a basic hands-on knowledge of a number of different software and data tools  that would allow them to create and manipulate their own linked data by taking advantage of existing resources in the  different communities (CH, public administration, GIS, etc.). They will also have been introduced to the role of Ontologies in integrating data and how to use a mapping tool to harmonise data at the schema level to a formal ontology standard.

The idea of conference is to learn from the experiences gained in the ITN DCH and INCEPTION projects and from the experiences of other researchers as well as professionals who are not involved in those two projects. In order to participate to the conference, the researchers will be asked to submit an abstract. The participants will be invited to submit full papers after the conference which will be peer reviewed and published by Springer in the book of the refereed conference proceedings similarly to series of books that emerged from the biennial EuroMed conferences.  In order to participate to the conference, the researchers will be asked to submit an abstract. Conference sessions will be chaired by ITN DCH fellows.</p>

<div class="col-lg-12">

  <p>The third day will be dedicated to practical session and open space discussions. Three main subjects will be identified during the meeting. Two cultural heritage sites will be visited: Olimje Monastery and Podsreda Castle. On each site the use of equipment and data acquisition exercise will be presented and the discussion on various aspects of digital heritage related to visited sites will be organized. </p>
<p>The Workshop aims to introduce the audience in the current state of the 3D documentation in CH. Through practical session; the participants will be introduced into the most common techniques in 3D documentation of CH (photogrammetry, laser scanner, structured light scanner) and software. Additionally, the workshop has the goal to enhance the skills of the audience and create a young scientist space for debating and exchange of ideas, knowledge and trace future research and technological directions.<br></br>

Nevertheless, the generation of high quality 3D models can be still very time-consuming and expensive, and the outcome of digital reconstructions is frequently provided in formats that are not interoperable, and therefore cannot be easily accessed. This challenge is even more crucial for complex architectures and large heritage sites, which involve a large amount of data to be acquired, managed and enriched by metadata. In order to face these challenges and to start solving the issue of the large amount of captured data and time-consuming processes in the production of 3D digital models, an Optimized Data Acquisition Protocol (DAP) has been set up. The purpose is to guide the processes of digitization of cultural heritage, respecting needs, requirements and specificities of cultural assets. Since every cultural asset is unique and requires survey, analysis and investigations “case by case”, according to many different characteristics and to the main purposes of survey and documentation procedures, the protocol is set as flexible guidelines considering different kind of instruments and devices, different accuracies and levels of detail, etc., in addition to site specifications and the uniqueness of Cultural Heritage. The DAP is also referred to data management (scan registration, data verification) data storage and archive. It is both a methodological procedure and an optimized workflow specification. The INCEPTION project has been applied under the Work Programme Europe in a changing world – inclusive, innovative and reflective Societies (Call - Reflective Societies: Cultural Heritage and European Identities, Reflective-7-2014, Advanced 3D modelling for accessing and understanding European cultural assets).

The project harnesses digital documentation methods and crowd sourcing to better serve the conservation and management of globally important heritage. The project is designed to provide rapid and substantive output that will be of immediate value. The project was initially devised to provide support to and highlight threatened or damaged sites in the Middle East and North Africa, although it is open to threatened heritage sites around the world. The project combines publicly donated images, together with other online resources to recreate 3D models of monuments and ancient sites using structure-from-motion. All reconstructed content will be placed in context using relevant site and landscape data. The long-term legacy of this project is the establishment of a framework that can be used anywhere in the world to help preserve vital information about historic sites. By integrating 3D heritage models into a spatial framework developed as a historic environment record tool we are providing the infrastructure for antiquities departments, museums and local authorities to be able to catalogue and manage heritage assets into the future.

In most of the cases, the large size and complex shape of the object may be demanding, while the level of detail needed in particular small scale areas of interest may need ad-hoc customisation during acquisition and processing steps using other methods. Thus, special requirements of such sites’ 3D reconstruction imply the sequence of several acquisition techniques towards a multi-scale approach. In this paper, we focus on this multi-scale image-based 3D reconstruction and explore two possible approaches for data registration: processing all image sets of different acquisition scales simultaneously and produce a unique point cloud or, alternatively, independent processing of the image-sets with subsequent point cloud fusion/registration. The ruins of Donaustauf Castle in Germany were chosen as a case study. The topography of the hill, the dense vegetation of the area and the large scale of the monument itself are the main challenges to be considered while setting the camera network configuration and deciding the acquisition platforms. This paper studies efficient ways for registration of image data sets coming from various camera networks of different scale, sensor and acquisition platform. To this end, two approaches for data integration are evaluated; from one hand the all-in-one solution, i.e. registering all image sets together and thus obtaining a single point cloud and secondly, performing individual registration per image group and subsequent use of ICP for the final fusion of the 3D products.')">Efficient registration of multi-platform camera networks</a></td><td>Matevž Domajnko</td><tr>

Object conservation procedures, such as examination, analysis, diagnosis, preventive or active conservation, require detailed and accurate documentation in textual or visual records which provide valuable information for the future researcher, curator or conservator. Furthermore, conservation requires the awareness of cultural, historical and scientific information from sources both internal (e.g. the museum collections management system) and external (e.g. online database of information on cultural heritage and preservation), which in turn influence the ways in which conservators must approach their work. This integration of different information forms the body of knowledge, relevant to thoughtful decisions on treatment and care of cultural heritage objects. Taking into consideration the diversity of conservation information and associated information sources, the integration cannot be regarded as a trivial task. Therefore, knowledge organization, especially in a concepts level, is necessary. An ontology approach could be applied for knowledge management and clarification of the concepts exact meaning. Such domain ontology could be useful for information systems design, information integration, development of internet services and semantic querying/search, supporting conservators work.

The ongoing EU funded INCEPTION project proposes an improvement in this methodology by recognising that buildings are a set of elements, organized by spatial relationships determined by an architectural style. Now, a shared library for historical elements does not exist. Starting from the so-called Heritage Building Information Modelling (H-BIM) approach the necessity of the libraries’ implementation will be reached by INCEPTION avoiding the oversimplification of the shapes. When used in models of cultural heritage, semantic BIM will be able to be connected to different users (e.g. scholars, technicians, citizens, governments) in support of the user’s need for interpretation of the cultural heritage model, in addition to the common BIM features of 3D visualization, technical specification and dataset. The first step in creating semantic BIM for cultural heritage is defining the ontology, a formal representation of knowledge as a hierarchy of concepts within the cultural heritage domain, using a shared vocabulary to denote the types, properties and interrelationships of cultural heritage aspects. For this reason, aiming at the standardization in heritage documentation data handling and management, the INCEPTION project is developing common parameters setting a nomenclature or “glossary of names” as a starting point to semantic enrichment and modelling in BIM environment. The recognition of shapes, either manually or automatically performed, is always possible only if single architectural elements (or their variations) are identified and univocally classified following a shared procedure.

The OFS was specifically built to simplify the faculty process for parishes. A series of trials had demonstrated that some parishes found it difficult to locate heritage data on their church buildings. To assist them, the CHR was designed to automatically feed heritage data directly into each faculty application thus saving the parishes’ time and effort. For OFS users involved in the decision making process, this means that they are always provided with data that has been verified and authenticated by the data officers with the data owners. The Church of England’s OFS is the only planning portal in England which is fully integrated with its Historic Environment Record. The development of the CHR has also enabled the Church to begin experimenting with new ways to share its data with external partners. The CHR has developed an OData web-service which returns data in JSON format and follows the web standard OData Protocol.

Documents and notes are written in hard-to-read historical handwriting and are often interspersed with illustrations. They are weakly structured and largely inaccessible to a wider public, or scientists and other experts. Traditionally, humanities researchers treat text and images separately. This separation extends to traditional handwriting recognition systems. Many of them use a segmentation free OCR approach which only allows the resolution of homogenous manuscripts in terms of layout, style and linguistic content. This is in contrast to our infrastructure which aims to resolve individual pages of a large corpus in which different languages and scripts are intermixed with images. Authors in our use case, a 17,000-page account of exploration of the Indonesian Archipelago between 1820-1850 (“Natuurkundige Commissie voor Nederlands-Indië”) tried to follow a semantic way to record their knowledge and their observations, however, this discipline does not exist in the handwriting script. The use of different languages including German, Latin, Dutch, Malay, Greek, and French makes interpretation more challenging. Our infrastructure takes the state-of-the-art word retrieval system MONK as starting point. Owing to its visual approach, MONK can handle the diversity of material we encounter in our use case and many other historical collections: text, drawings and images.

So far we have conducted two in-lab experiments to collect mixed data from specialist users. First, we compared three Digital Editions with a task-based approach coupled with both an exit survey and a focus group, and found out that usability is valued higher than content features for the majority of participants. In the second experiment, we compared a digital edition with a PDF eBook and a printed book. The general set-up was similar: we gave the participants ad-hoc designed tasks to solve, observed them (electronically), gave them an exit survey and then asked them to discuss their experience amongst themselves in a typical focus group. As a clear result, we found that most of the participants preferred PDF, not only because of its higher availability, mobility and compatibility with different software, but also because of the inherent usability of having a “search function”, “clearer navigation”, “ability to comment”, and “familiarity with the interface”.')">Minimal functionality for digital editions</a></td><td>Federico Caria</td><tr>

Gamification accordingly is an approach that museums follow in order to provide edutainment experience and to attract children. However, most of gamification techniques used in museums offer individual experiences (e.g. small touch screens or personalized applications). Nevertheless, museums recently began to design and deploy tangible user interfaces in order to physicalize the experience with museum objects, which is more collaborative, attract more visitors, and persuade them to explore further. This study aims to communicate tacit knowledge of Egyptian built heritage to young museum visitors by combining tangible interaction with gamification, making their experience more collaborative and engaging. Egyptian heritage is very rich in content, containing many aspects of tacit knowledge which is relatively challenging to communicate, such as architectural qualities, historical values and artistic features. We therefore introduce the approach of tangible gamification, we argue it has several objectives; (a) making museum experience more collaborative and enhances social interaction, (b) actively engaging young visitors by allowing them to physically explore museum collections, and (c) stimulating subtle learning experiences by communicating heritage information during interactions. We propose three different interaction setups for conducting our experimental study in a real museum environment on a scale 1:1 of an original ancient Egyptian tomb-chapel in order to investigate how this approach augments collaboration and social interaction among young visitors, and how this influences their cultural learning.')">Collaborative Tangible Gamification of Built Heritage for Young Museum Visitors</a></td><td>Eslam Nofal</td><tr>

Such Virtual narrators are reconstructed out of real ones and have the ability for verbal as well as nonverbal communication skills. In this work, we compare latest 3D reconstruction methodologies of realistic Virtual characters by capturing real human geometry from simple photographs. This topic of research remains open since there are no straightforward methods of accurate and automatic reconstruction of high resolution virtual characters from real humans without significant human processing of the gathered data.')">Rapid reconstruction and simulation of real characters in Mixed Reality environments</a></td><td>Margarita Papaefthymiou</td><tr>

We have produced a 4D (3D with another scale of time) interactive virtual heritage tour for Famagusta’s Armenian church in Cyprus, in which one single user can virtually walk around and inside the church, interact with interactive buttons to check out more pop-up information about the church, and play with the interactive timeline function to see how the church has changed over time. Human movement scanning is also applied to create more engaging storytelling experiences. After we have launched the phase one standalone virtual experiences to a group of audience, we have observed their behaviours, gathered their feedback, and identified a few ways to improve the storytelling and education experiences. Meanwhile, we have tested multi-user guided storytelling at various occasions. Such experiences and feedback then lead us to the phase two development of the virtual heritage experiences, namely, 4D multi-user guided interactive experiences for heritage storytelling and education. This paper explains the new approaches we have taken for the phase two development, and a few hypotheses we aim to test in the upcoming phase three development.')">Four-dimensional multi-user guided interactive experiences for heritage storytelling and education</a></td><td>Yi Yuan</td><tr>-->

                             <p><small>Olimje Castle (Slovene: Grad Olimje) is a 16th-century castle located in the settlement of Olimje, part of the Municipality of Podčetrtek in eastern Slovenia. It is currently a Franciscan monastery.</small> </p>
                             <p><small>The site of the castle is occupied since 1000 a.C. Around 1550 the complete castle was rebuilt in renaissance style and a defensive ditch to guard against Turkish incursions. In 1663 was donated to brothers of the Pauline order from Lepoglava, Croatia. Between 1665 and 1675, they completed the conversion and added a baroque church, whose altar of the Assumption of Mary is considered one of the finest baroque altars in Slovenia. In 1740, the monk Ivan Ranger painted the entire presbytery, and a side chapel was built and decorated. The Paulines also established a pharmacy, among the oldest in Europe.</small></p>
                             <p><small>The castle was nationalized after World War II. In 1974, a major earthquake badly damaged it; soon afterward it was thoroughly renovated with the assistance of national, municipal, and parish funds. The sanctuary and parish were given to the Conventual Franciscans in 1990. On the 15th of August, 1999, they revived the monastery after 217 years. Today they care for both pilgrims and the tourists visiting the historic castle and pharmacy. Due to public interest, they have also established a herbal apothecary.</small></p>

                                       </div>
                                         <p><small>Originally known as Hörberg Castle, Podsreda was built in the first half of the 12th century by the Breže-Seliški counts (first mentioned in 1213). The high defense tower, Great Hall and tower with chapel were added to the original simple square form in a later period. The castle changed hands numerous times in the ensuing centuries, until Count Sigmund von Tattenbach acquired a permanent and hereditary title to it in 1617. In around 1848 the estate was bought by Duke Weriand von Windischgrätz and remained in the Windischgrätz family thereafter until the end of the World War II.</small> </p>
                                         <p><small>There are permanent exhibitions of glassworks and an exhibition about the history of the castle. A collection of color woodcuts from around 1860 illustrating medieval furnishings and clothes, plus color lithographs of castles in Štajerska from the 1830s and 1860s donated by Kurt Müller, a regular guest of the Rogaška Slatina spa for many years. A particular attraction is a functional castle kitchen, to which the renovation has lent the appearance of a medieval kitchen. The castle is the venue for an annual Summer Music programme organized by <a href="http://www.culture.si/en/Kozjanski_Park_Public_Institute">Kozjanski Park Public Institute</a>.</small></p>
                                         <p><small>The castle has been included in the Ema's Roman Path (funded through Interreg III A Slovenia-Austria) that connects the places linked to the life of the Saint Hema (Ema Krška) in Austria and Slovenia. The <a href="http://www.culture.si/en/Kozjanski_Park_Public_Institute">Kozjanski Park Public Institute</a> is also a partner in the TRANSROMANICA – The Romanesque Routes of European Heritage project (funded through Interreg III B Cadses). The Podsreda Castle is one of the five Romanic monuments in Europe that form a common tourist trail. It has been cooperating also in the Interreg IVC project HISTCAPE-Historic assets and related landscape with partners from eleven European countries.</small></p>
